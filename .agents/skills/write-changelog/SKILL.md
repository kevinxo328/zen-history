You are writing a user-facing changelog entry for a macOS manga translation app. Your job is to turn git commit messages into plain-language release notes that tell users what's new, what's fixed, and what's improved — without any technical details.

## Step 1: Ask for version number

Ask the user: "What version number is this release? (e.g. v1.2.0)"

## Step 2: Gather commits

Run the following to find commits since the last tag:

```bash
git log $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD --oneline
```

If no tag exists yet, use:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

## Step 3: Categorize commits

Ignore these commit types entirely — they are not user-facing:
- `docs:` — documentation, changelogs, specs, openspec artifacts
- `refactor:` — internal code restructuring
- `chore:` / `ci:` / `test:` — maintenance

Map the remaining commits to changelog sections:

| Commit prefix | Changelog section |
|---------------|------------------|
| `feat:` | New Features |
| `fix:` | Bug Fixes |
| `perf:` / improvements to UX | Improvements |

## Step 4: Write user-facing descriptions

For each relevant commit, rewrite it from the user's perspective. Follow these rules:

**Tone and language:**
- Write for a non-technical user
- Use plain, friendly, conversational English
- Describe what the user can now do, or what problem is solved
- Never mention code, APIs, refactors, data models, placeholders, or internal system names
- Never use jargon like "UUID", "model", "service", "handler", "tag preservation", etc.

**Format rules:**
- **New Features**: Use `**Feature Name** — one sentence describing the user benefit`
- **Bug Fixes**: Use `- Fixed [what was broken] [in what situation]`
- **Improvements**: Use `- [What changed] so that [user benefit]`

**Examples of good rewrites:**

| Raw commit | User-facing text |
|---|---|
| `feat: add glossary system and cross-page context` | `**Glossary** — Pin your preferred translations for character names, places, and terms. The translator will follow your glossary consistently across every page.` |
| `fix: use UUID for bubble highlight tracking` | `Fixed bubble numbering showing duplicate numbers in some cases` |
| `feat: check for updates on app focus with 1-hour cooldown` | `App now checks for updates when you switch back to it, so you'll discover new versions faster` |
| `fix: make ⌘O work when an image is already open` | `Fixed ⌘O not working when an image is already open` |

**Multiple commits about the same feature** should be merged into one entry.

## Step 5: Format the changelog block

Use today's date. Format:

```markdown
## v<VERSION> (<YYYY-MM-DD>)

### New Features

- **Feature Name** — Description of user benefit.
- **Another Feature** — Description.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed something that was broken.

### Improvements

- Some improvement so users get a benefit.
```

Only include sections that have entries. If there are no bug fixes, omit the `### Bug Fixes` section entirely.

## Step 6: Prepend to CHANGELOG.md

Insert the new block at the top of CHANGELOG.md, just below the `# Changelog` heading, with a blank line before the next existing entry.

Then show the user the new entry and say: "Added to CHANGELOG.md. Review and edit if needed."
